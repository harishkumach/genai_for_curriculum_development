Example prompt for generating assignment problem from scratch:
-------------------------

I am teaching a course in control theory. This is a senior undergrad/lower-level grad course.
I want to autogenerate questions on the topic I am teaching.
The topic is: “State feedback control”.
Learning outcome: Given the control problem context in natural language, students should be able to
formulate the state space equation, and design a state feedback controller using the LQR method.
The question should have the following parts:
1. A natural language description of a control problem to control the position of the rotor of a DC motor.
2. physics equations governing the DC motor.
3. explicit requirements for the control problem.
4. A list of specific outputs which will be graded
5. A rubic to grade the problem

Example prompt for generating variations on an existing problem:
-------------------------
The attached file has an assignment problem I gave in a previous semester. I want to you create a different
problem with similar learning outcomes. Generate the output in a latex format which I can copy-paste into
a latex editor.
