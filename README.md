# genai_for_curriculum_development

This repository contains examples for using Generative AI for curriculum development. 

*Current Status:* Uploaded examples for auto-generating assignment problems. 
1. The file "Auto_generate_control_problem.pdf" contains an example where a description of the problem is provided in the prompt, and AI generates the desired problem statement.
2. The second worklflow is creating a variation of an existing problem. The file "file_provided_to_gpt.pdf" provides an existing problem statement. The file "generation_variations_in_a_problem.pdf" contains the corresponding prompt and the generated output, which is a variation of the problem.

To replicate the above examples, please copy-paste the prompts form the .pdf files into GenAI interface. Note: the results you see may vary slightly from the result in the .pdf files.
